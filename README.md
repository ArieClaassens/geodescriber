# GeoDescriber

GeoDescriber is a geoprocessing tool which uses natural language generation to describe the landscape of a place.

• It uses the living atlas, the best available global data, as its data cube.

• It can be made available to text-to-speech engines for section 508 compliance. Therefore, it can describe what a map is showing to visually impaired readers.

• GeoDescriber’s descriptions are useful in online map popups.

• If a professional writer is used to edit the output, GeoDescriber simplifies their task. They simply edit GeoDescriber’s descriptions to make them their own style.

• If a professional writer is not used to edit the output, GeoDescriber’s descriptions are already finished and grammatically correct.

• GeoDescriber is useful in essays, for wikipedia, or wherever technical descriptions of landscapes are required.

GeoDescriber may be adapted and applied to other physical descriptions, as well as to cultural or economic descriptions.
