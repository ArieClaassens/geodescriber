# GeoDescriber

<b>GeoDescriber</b> is a geoprocessing tool which uses natural language generation to describe the landscape of a place.

• It uses the Living Atlas, the best available global data, as its data cube.

• It can be made available to text-to-speech engines for section 508 compliance. Therefore, it can describe what a map is showing to visually impaired readers.

• <b>GeoDescriber's</b> descriptions are useful in online map popups.

• If a professional writer is used to edit the output, <b>GeoDescriber</b> simplifies their task. They simply edit GeoDescriber’s descriptions to make them their own style.

• If a professional writer is not used to edit the output, <b>GeoDescriber's</b> descriptions are already finished and grammatically correct.

• <b>GeoDescriber</b> is useful in essays, for wikipedia, or wherever technical descriptions of landscapes are required.

<b>GeoDescriber</b> may be adapted and applied to other physical descriptions, as well as to cultural or economic descriptions.
